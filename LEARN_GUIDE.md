# Become AI Researcher

Even high-schoolers are capable of learning to do AI researach with some time.

One of our goals is to train & create researchers.

You may go into study mode or do projects. I recommend doing both and following your curiosity.

Don't chase perfection and get overwhelmed by the difficulty. Chase progress.

Progress might feel slow at times, but that feeling is false and irrelevant, just put in the hours and you will get there.

LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT) can help you learn fast and well since they know these fundamentals well, just ask them to explain things below.

Here are some things to learn (you will eventually know all of this, so study whatever feels interesting):

---

## Math

1.  **Linear Algebra**: Tensors, matrix multiplication, and vector spaces.
2.  **Calculus**: Derivatives, partial derivatives, and the Chain Rule.
3.  **Probability & Statistics**: Random variables, distributions.

---

## PyTorch

1.  **Tensors**: `view()`, `transpose()`, `reshape()`.
2.  **Operations**: `torch.matmul`, `einsum`, indexing, slicing.
3.  **Autograd**: Automatic differentiation, gradients.

---

## Fundamentals

1.  **Components**: Weighted sums, biases, neurons.
2.  **Activations**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, SwiGLU.
3.  **Training**: CrossEntropy, MSE, KL Divergence, Backpropagation.

---

## Architectures

1.  **Transformers**: Attention Mechanism, Queries, Keys, Values.
2.  **Vision**: CNNs, spatial hierarchies, kernels.
3.  **State Space Models**: SSMs, Mamba.

These are ideas. You may ask LLMs to suggest more things to study or pick up a project and learn as you go.
