# Auto AI Research System - UI Implementation

This is the frontend UI implementation for the **Auto AI Research System** - a fully autonomous, web-based AI research platform.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Pages
- **Projects Dashboard** - Grid view of all research projects with filtering and search
- **Project Detail** - Comprehensive project view with tabbed interface
- **Run Detail** - Real-time monitoring of autonomous runs with live logs and metrics

### ✅ UI Components
- Modern, responsive design using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Consistent navigation with AppLayout wrapper
- Interactive dialogs for project creation
- Progress bars and status indicators
- Real-time log viewing
- Metric displays and charts placeholders

### ✅ Navigation Structure
```
/projects                    - Projects dashboard
/projects/[id]              - Project detail with tabs
/projects/[id]/runs/[runId] - Run detail with live monitoring
```

## 🎨 Design System

Built with:
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **shadcn/ui** - Modern component library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Clean, consistent icons
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout

## 📱 Responsive Features

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Collapsible navigation on mobile devices
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly interfaces

## 🔧 Mock Data

The UI includes comprehensive mock data to demonstrate:
- Multiple project states (running, completed, paused, failed)
- Live run monitoring with progress tracking
- Real-time logs and metrics
- Timeline view of agent execution steps
- Budget tracking and cost monitoring

## 🎯 Key User Flows

### 1. Project Management
- Create new projects with templates
- View project grid with search and filters
- Quick actions (pause, resume, stop)
- Budget and cost tracking

### 2. Run Monitoring
- Real-time progress tracking
- Live log streaming
- Timeline of agent steps
- Configuration viewing and editing
- Metric dashboards

### 3. Navigation
- Consistent top navigation
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Mobile-responsive menu
- User profile dropdown

## 🚧 Ready for Backend Integration

The UI is designed to easily connect to backend services:
- All data is currently mocked but uses realistic data structures
- API-ready component architecture
- WebSocket placeholders for real-time updates
- Proper state management patterns

## 🔄 Next Steps

To complete the system:
1. Connect to FastAPI backend
2. Implement real-time WebSocket connections
3. Add actual chart rendering (recharts/chart.js)
4. Integrate with GPU providers (Novita AI)
5. Add authentication and user management
6. Implement file upload and artifact management
