# Introduction to Neural Networks

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a **computational model** inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain work. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information.

Think of it as a **function approximator** that learns patterns from data!

## The Biological Inspiration

Just like neurons in your brain:
- Receive signals from multiple sources (dendrites)
- Process the information (cell body)
- Fire a signal if threshold is exceeded (axon)

Artificial neurons work similarly:
- Receive weighted inputs from previous layer
- Sum them up and add bias
- Apply activation function
- Send output to next layer

## Basic Architecture

A typical neural network has **three types of layers**:

### Input Layer
- Receives the raw data (features)
- One neuron per feature
- No computation happens here

**Example:** For a 28x28 grayscale image: 784 input neurons (28 √ó 28)

### Hidden Layer(s)
- Performs computations
- Extracts features from the data
- Can have multiple hidden layers (deep learning!)

**The more layers:**
- More complex patterns can be learned
- But also harder to train

### Output Layer
- Produces the final prediction
- Number of neurons depends on the task:
  - 1 neuron: binary classification or regression
  - N neurons: N-class classification

## How Does a Single Neuron Work?

Each neuron performs a simple operation:

```
1. Weighted Sum: z = w‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + w‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ... + w‚Çôx‚Çô + b
2. Activation:   a = œÉ(z)
3. Output:       a becomes input to next layer
```

**Example calculation:**
```
Inputs: x = [2, 3]
Weights: w = [0.5, 0.3]
Bias: b = 0.1

Step 1: z = 0.5(2) + 0.3(3) + 0.1 = 2.0
Step 2: a = ReLU(2.0) = 2.0
Step 3: Output = 2.0
```

## The Learning Process

Neural networks learn through **supervised learning**:

### 1. Initialize
Start with random weights and biases

### 2. Forward Pass
Pass data through the network to get predictions

### 3. Calculate Loss
Measure how wrong the predictions are

```
Loss = (prediction - actual)¬≤
```

### 4. Backward Pass (Backpropagation)
Calculate gradients: how much each weight contributed to the error

### 5. Update Weights
Adjust weights in the direction that reduces loss

```
w_new = w_old - learning_rate √ó gradient
```

### 6. Repeat
Do this for many iterations (epochs) until the model performs well

## Types of Neural Networks

### Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
- Information flows in one direction: input ‚Üí hidden ‚Üí output
- Used for: tabular data, simple classification

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Specialized for image data
- Uses filters to detect features
- Used for: computer vision, image classification

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Has memory of previous inputs
- Used for: time series, text, speech

### Transformers
- Attention mechanism
- Used for: language models (GPT, BERT), machine translation

## Real-World Applications

| Domain | Application | Network Type |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| üñºÔ∏è Computer Vision | Image classification, object detection | CNN |
| üí¨ NLP | Chatbots, translation, text generation | Transformer |
| üéµ Audio | Speech recognition, music generation | RNN, Transformer |
| üéÆ Gaming | Game AI, reinforcement learning | Deep Q-Networks |
| üè• Healthcare | Disease diagnosis, drug discovery | CNN, FNN |
| üí∞ Finance | Fraud detection, stock prediction | FNN, LSTM |

## Why Neural Networks Work

### Universal Approximation Theorem
With enough neurons and the right activation functions, a neural network can approximate **any continuous function**!

### Feature Learning
Unlike traditional ML, neural networks **automatically learn** the important features from raw data. No manual feature engineering needed!

### Scalability
Neural networks get better with:
- More data
- More compute
- Better architectures

## Key Components Summary

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Weights (w)** | Parameters to learn, control signal strength |
| **Bias (b)** | Shifts the activation function |
| **Activation Function** | Introduces non-linearity |
| **Loss Function** | Measures prediction error |
| **Optimizer** | Updates weights to minimize loss |

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Overfitting
**Problem:** Model memorizes training data  
**Solution:** Dropout, regularization, more data

### 2. Vanishing Gradients
**Problem:** Gradients become too small in deep networks  
**Solution:** ReLU activation, batch normalization, skip connections

### 3. Slow Training
**Problem:** Takes too long to converge  
**Solution:** Better optimizers (Adam), GPU acceleration, batch processing

### 4. Need Lots of Data
**Problem:** Neural networks are data-hungry  
**Solution:** Transfer learning, data augmentation, synthetic data
