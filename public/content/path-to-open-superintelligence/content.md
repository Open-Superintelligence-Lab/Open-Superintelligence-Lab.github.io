Nobody knows what superintelligence will look like or how to make it.

Therefore, our roadmap will not be a linear path from A to B. It will be a **strategic framework for exploration, learning, and collective progress.** It's about creating a machine that discovers the path.

**The Mission:** To create open and transparent Superintelligence that benefits everyone.
1.  **Core Principles:**
    *   **Radical Openness:** All code is open source (e.g., MIT/Apache 2.0 license). All research discussions happen in public ([Discord](https://discord.gg/6AbXGpKTwN)). All findings are shared ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XJj9pv_11a11FUxCMz15g), [blog posts](https://opensuperintelligencelab.com/), pre-prints).
    *   **Distributed Collaboration:** Intelligence is everywhere. We welcome contributors from all backgrounds. A great PR is a great PR, regardless of its author's credentials.
    *   **Educational Core:** Our primary output is not just the code, but a generation of researchers and engineers who build it.
    *   **Pragmatic Exploration:** We follow clear principles but stay flexible. Weâ€™ll explore different directions â€” LLMs, World Models, Video Generation, JEPA and more.
2.  **The Grand Challenge:** Our goal is not to execute a known plan, but to build a community and a research engine capable of discovering it.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Capabilities & Lab Bootstrapping (The First 6 Months)**

The goal of the Phase 1 is not to invent ASI, but to build the tools, skills, and community that *will*. This phase is perfect for training our new workforce.

*   **Objective:** Achieve SOTA on well-understood problems and build a robust, open-source ML infrastructure - [LLM](https://github.com/Open-Superintelligence-Lab/blueberry-llm), JEPA, Video Gen, World Models, TRM (HRM)

1. Creating custom optimizer for each part of a model - [Manifold Muon](https://github.com/Open-Superintelligence-Lab/blueberry-llm/issues/36). [More research tasks here](https://github.com/Open-Superintelligence-Lab/blueberry-llm/issues)

2.  **V-JEPA:** The hypothesis is that a system that can accurately predict the future (in some abstract representation space, by learning to predict videos) will have learned a fundamental understanding of the world.
*Project:* Implement V-JEPA-2. Come up with research questions and directions. Make videos, blog posts and encourage community exploration.

1. **3D-World Generation:** Following "The Bitter Lesson" (general algorithm + compute scaling eventually wins) - understand how to generate virtual worlds efficiently where AI models can learn on their own by interacting with them.

#### **Phase 2: The Next Models(Long-term Vision)**

This is the long-term phase. The goal is to take the most successful outcomes from Phase 1 and begin combining them into novel, unified architectures.

*   *Example:* What if V-JEPA's world understanding could servea as the "thinking" for agents navigating 3D-generated worlds? How can LLMs be integrated here?
