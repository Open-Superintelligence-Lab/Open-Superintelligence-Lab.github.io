## The Process
You are responsible for most of the work, with my direct help and feedback. The goal is to produce high-signal content that advances the field.

### The Golden Rule
**No AI generated text.** AI may be used as a tool during creation, but the final blog must be human-written.

### Research Post Tracks
- **AI Research Post**: Select a relevant research topic, code small high-signal experiments, and describe the math, experiments, and results.
- **Tutorial / Explanation**: Write a detailed explanation of a research paper, detailing specific experiments or mathematical concepts. Create the guides we wish existed.

> *"Author has total freedom to choose topics."*

## Possible Contributions
- **Explain the Paper**: Translate high-level concepts and intuition into clear, narrative explanations.
- **Background Math**: Deep-dive into the formal mathematical foundations and proofs.
- **Implement Code**: Write clean, modular PyTorch or Triton code for the research logic.
- **Training Dataset**: Build the data pipelines and synthetic environments needed for experiments.
- **Empirical Analysis**: Run experiments, collect insights, and visualize the results.
- **Peer Review**: Collaborate on existing work and provide technical feedback.
